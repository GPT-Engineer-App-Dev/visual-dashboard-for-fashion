# visual-dashboard-for-fashion

Inventory management for a fashion supply chain company. Create 4 cards on the top that summarize the information. For example, total items, items by categories, items by location and reorder alerts. Do not add an `add item` button. This is more of a visual dashboard rather than something you can add items to. The table should have columns "Item	SKU	Quantity	Location	Last Updated". Generate a few rows with mock data. There should be a `filter` and a `export` button
